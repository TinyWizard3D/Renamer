<h1>Renamer Toolkit</h1>

<h2>Introduction</h2>
Renamer Toolkit is a PySide2 and Python/PyMel-based tool developed specifically for Autodesk Maya.<br>
Built with seamless Maya UI integration in mind, it enables renaming and management of scene objects, adhering closely to production requirements and naming conventions. The toolkit provides robust handling for complex renaming tasks, hierarchical structures, and node-type specificity, offering flexible and efficient workflow improvements directly within Maya's native interface.
<br><br>The Renamer Toolkit contains four distinct menus—Rename, Find, Delete, and Group—each dedicated to specific functionalities within Maya for efficient object management.
